## Initial assumptions for research

Let's assume you are a Software Engineer, which have a strong theoretical and practical background of IT Science, 
common algorithms, architectures and commercial software development.

You are also interested in blockchain technology, you had a chance to use various dApps, wallets,
transactions on many blockchains and so on. Maybe you listened of Smart Contracts (or already tried to write some), 
read the Bitcoin WhitePaper and some books/articles about it. 

You've reached the point, where you are wondering what skills and knowledge area you need
to become a Blockchain Developer. Maybe you would like to make a choice according to your interests?
You also need to know what kinds of jobs and positions exist in the blockchain industry.
What is the difference between them?

I've started to wonder about that too. That's why I've checked out job listings at over the TOP 200
blockchain companies and read many publications on the subject. In this article I would like to share
with you my observations and conclusions. 

In my opinion it is worth consciously considering at the outset which path to take
before completely immersing yourself in the subject. My aim was to get a good idea
of the possible paths forward in this new field. It costs me a bit of effort, 
so I hope it will be useful to you as well :)
