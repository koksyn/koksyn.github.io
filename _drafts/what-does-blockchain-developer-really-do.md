title: What does the Blockchain Developer really do?
categories: [Research]
excerpt: Let's decrypt the mystery behind this title. I have described the activities that a Blockchain Developer
can do. These are also grouped into categories and compared to available jobs in the market.
It turns out, that they are the various perspectives and types of responsibilities.

## Initial assumptions for research

#### Background

Let's assume you are a Software Engineer, which have a strong theoretical and practical background of IT Science, 
common algorithms, architectures and commercial software development.

You are also interested in blockchain technology, you had a chance to use various dApps, wallets,
transactions on many blockchains and so on. Maybe you listened of Smart Contracts (or already tried to write some), 
read the Bitcoin WhitePaper and some books/articles about it. 

You've reached the point, where you are wondering what skills and knowledge area you need
to become a Blockchain Developer. Maybe you would like to make a choice according to your interests?
You also need to know what kinds of jobs and positions exist in the blockchain industry.
What is the difference between them?

#### Goals

I've started to wonder about that too. That's why I've checked out job listings at over the TOP 200
blockchain companies and read many publications on the subject. In this article I would like to share
with you my observations and conclusions. 

In my opinion it is worth consciously considering at the outset which path to take
before completely immersing yourself in the subject. My aim was to get a good idea
of the possible paths forward in this new field. It costs me a bit of effort, 
so I hope it will be useful to you as well :)

## Technical activities

List of activities you can do on technical side:

- Write and deploy Smart Contracts.
- Develop libs or apps, which interacts with Smart Contracts.
- Read and process data from Blockchain.
- Create an Oracle.
- Build a Bridge between Blockchains.
- Develop blockchain nodes / systems from scratch.

Each activity can be useful in several use-cases. 
We will describe them further in the article as well.

### 1. Write and deploy Smart Contracts.
### 2. Develop libs or apps, which interacts with Smart Contracts.
### 3. Read and process data from Blockchain.
### 4. Create an Oracle.
### 5. Build a Bridge between Blockchains.
### 6. Develop blockchain nodes / systems from scratch.

## Use-cases

- Cryptocurrency Wallet
- Centralized cryptocurrency exchange
- Decentralized cryptocurrency exchange
- Authorization through NFT ownership
- Authorization through Blockchain Wallet
- NFT Marketplaces
- API libraries for interaction with Blockchain
- Data storage
- Existence on many blockchains
- Supply chain
- Using data outside blockchain

## Two main paths for Blockchain Developer

- Building apps on blockchain (usability)

> TODO: description. E.g. Help a companies to use blockchain, build apps, tools, startups,
> process data from, basically everything around it.

- Building blockchain internally (core, fundaments)

> TODO: description. E.g. Nodes, libraries, APIs, cryptography, security, testnet's, system design,
> consensus/quorum algorithms, etc.
