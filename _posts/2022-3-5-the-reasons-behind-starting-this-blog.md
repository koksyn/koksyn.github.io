## What is ChainPath?

Hello stranger, I am glad that you are here!

A **ChainPath blog** is a place, where I describe (and will describe continuously)
my own path in becoming a professional **Blockchain Engineer**.

This publication is just the beginning of that way, the first little step.

## Why?

First things first I will answer why I am doing that :smirk:

#### Previous experience with blogging

I had some experience in writing several **technical publications** in the past, 
but those blogs were focused on delivering a specific knowledge/advices from perspective
of experienced **Senior Backend Developer**, which already knows well the topics he described.

Now, however the situation is slightly different. I decided to go beyond my so called *"comfort-zone"* (**Web 2.0** tech)
and jump into the world of rising technology nowadays of **Web 3.0** (*Blockchain* technology).

I also spent a lot of time to promote those blogs, put them high on the lists inside the search engines 
(mostly by various SEO techniques) and so on and so forth. In the long run this marketing and SEO stuff exhausted me a lot.
So much so that I have lost the will to continue creating these blogs.

Important point is I have learned my lesson. Instead of wasting energy in *"Marketing & SEO"* I will just delegate those
tasks to another person in the future. My **real goal** is to deliver a valuable content, which will **help you** also in **your
way** to becoming a **Blockchain Engineer**. I hope, of course :blush: no guarantee, but I will try.

That's why I decided to go with almost *"plain-text"* blog built on *GitHub Pages*. 
No SEO, no marketing, no promotion at least on the beginning.
Just the knowledge (content I delivered), me and you. Simple.

#### Teaching by documenting discoveries

Through my career I realised I am really satisfied in **teaching people** things I am passionate about.
Blockchain is one of them - moreover it's the most exciting and interesting area of next specialization for me.

As you can probably guess I am **not** an expert in this area, so this will not be a blog with the best practices, patterns, 
the shortest ways to do some things in Blockchain etc. Don't expect that yet :)

Instead of that I will bring you something like a **"Tech Diary"**,
which will describe my thoughts, ideas, obstacles, achievements, interesting (and probably important!) discoveries
while learning and practicing the *Blockchain* development.

## Finding your niche

I have started programming when I was a teenager (a long long time ago :) ), thus I followed my passion and became a professional.
During almost 12 years of commercial experience I created mainly **web applications** (starting with small and simple and ending with complex and powerful apps)
I delivered **frontend** and **backend** services, configured various servers, Cloud infrastructure, tools for CI/CD, designed software architecture,
been a Tech Lead and so on. I also have an opportunity to implement some *SmartContracts* in *Solidity* in one of the company I cooperated with. 

#### And you know what?

As a **Senior Software Engineer** I started to hit a glass ceiling. Repetition of some topics unfortunately led me to boredom.
A programmer apart from the job itself often learns new things, the problem starts when less and less issues are new to you.
Sometimes the solution is to explore some different technologies, sometimes changing the project (or job) 
will help you with change the environment. Finding your **niche** can also be a solution, then you are naturally curious 
about these subjects and want to explore them. 

For me that **niche** is **Blockchain**. Because it is developing so strongly and widely, that I am unable to keep up with it, 
which means that I will probably still have something new to learn on the subject. And that is exactly what 
I have been looking for so long, which I also wish for you ;)

That's all for now. Expect new content in the future :wink:
